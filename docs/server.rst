Syslog Server
=============

Syslog server is central concentration for syslog messages. Additionally, it
provides web interface for real time monitoring and filtering of log messages.

Syslog listening socket can be configured as TCP, UDP or TCP+SSL socket.
Communication is based on RFC 5425, RFC 5426, RFC 6587. Once message is
received, server stores message in predefined database.

.. warning::

    Current implementation of Syslog server doesn't support UDP communication

Running
-------

Syslog Server is implemented as python `hat.syslog.server` package which
can be run with ``hat-syslog`` script with additional command line
arguments:

    .. program-output:: python -m hat.syslog.server --help

This application is part of `hat-syslog` python package.


Configuration
-------------

Syslog Server configuration written in form of single YAML or JSON file
with structure defined by JSON Schema ``hat-syslog://server.yaml#``.
Path to configuration file is provided as command line argument during process
startup. Additionally, configuration parameters provided in configuration file
can be overridden by command line arguments. If configuration file could not be
found, default values of configuration parameters are used.

Example of configuration::

    ---
    type: syslog
    log:
        version: 1
    syslog_addr: 'tcp://0.0.0.0:6514'
    ui_addr: 'http://0.0.0.0:23020'
    dp_path: 'syslog.db'
    db_low_size: 1_000_000
    db_high_size: 10_000_000
    db_enable_archive: false
    db_disable_journal: false
    ...


Data backend
------------

All incoming syslog messages are stored in single sqlite database. Maximum
number of syslog messages stored in this database can be configured by
configuration parameter ``db_high_size`` (value ``0`` represents unlimited
number of messages). Once number of messages exceed configured limit,
database cleanup procedure is triggered. During cleanup procedure, oldest
messages are removed from database until number of messages reaches
configuration parameter ``db_low_size`` when cleanup procedure stops. Prior
to message deletion, if configuration parameter ``db_enable_archive``
is set, new database with unique file name is created and all messages
scheduled for removal are inserted into newly created database. Archive
database has got same structure as original database and can be used in place
of original database for accessing archived syslog messages.


Web UI
------

Together with acquiring and storing syslog messages, Syslog Server provides
web-based user interface for querying messages from database and observing
changes in real time. Communication between web server and browser is
based on juggler communication.


Server state
''''''''''''

Server state is used for providing continuously updated list of log entries
to clients, based on applied filters.

State structure is defined by JSON schema
``hat-syslog://juggler.yaml#/definitions/state``.


Request/response
''''''''''''''''

Juggler request/response communication is used for changing filter parameters.

Request data structures are defined by JSON schema
``hat-syslog://juggler.yaml#/definitions/request``.

In case of successful request execution, response data is ``null``.
